@article{Hamilton:1837nr,
	Annote = {This is the paper presented in 1833 at the Royal Irish Academy about complex numbers.

"The third part, The Theory of Conjugate Functions, or Algebraic Couples, defines complex numbers as `algebraic couples', which are ordered pairs of real numbers, with appropriately defined operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Hamilton gives a careful proof of basic properties of the exponential function, and discusses the nature of logarithms, providing a natural framework to justify results obtained by his friend John T. Graves concerning complex logarithms which had been questioned by eminent British mathematicians such as Peacock and Herschel."},

Could be a useful example of "leaky isomorphism": embedding two things that look superficially identical but sometimes have very different behaviors.},
