\chapter{Introduction}

Much of the history of programming languages has been about increasing abstraction
and generalization. Today we take it for granted that a single suitably powerful
language could be used for nearly any programming task, were it not for pragmatic
factors beyond our control. Over time, many special-purpose languages
have been subsumed by these more powerful and general languages.
The field of technical computing --- programming for applied math and the
sciences --- is something of a holdout from this trend, with its own
purpose-built languages still dominating.
There are probably many reasons for this, including historical, social and
technical.

In this work we will focus on the technical reasons for this, and the
problems that the current state of affairs causes.

What do we mean by a \emph{language} for scientific computing?
The prevailing
answer is that it is about numeric arrays, perhaps matrices specifically,
and numerical libraries that use them.
Instead we intend to argue that, at a
deeper level, it is about certain kinds of flexibility, particularly
flexibility in the behavior of key operators and functions. This flexibility
is needed to maximize composability and reusability in scientific code.
Without it, certain programs may be easy to write today, but changing
functional and performance requirements can become difficult to meet.


A new programming language is not the only thing the world of technical
computing needs. Compiler techniques, library design, high-performance
computational kernels, and approaches to parallelism are all important,
and can usually be applied within multiple languages. For example the C
and Fortran language families have taken on many changes and extensions
over the years to accomodate new technologies. So we do not expect a
new language to ``solve'' technical computing all by itself, but rather
we want to ask whether any language-level abstractions can provide a
better base for high-productivity technical computing.


It is clear that scientific and technical users have their own particular
needs. So far there have been two paths available for fulfilling these
needs: using a mainstream general-purpose language like C++ or Java, or
designing a new language like R or MATLAB. Designing your own language
seems like a drastic thing to do, and yet it is unusually common in
technical computing (see gang of 40).

Figure~\ref{PLpriorities} compares the general design priorities of mainstream programming
languages to those of technical computing languages. The priorities in each row are not
necessarily opposites or even mutually exclusive, but rather are a matter of emphasis.
For example, it is certainly possible to have both parametric and ad-hoc polymorphism within
the same language, but syntax, recommended idioms, and the design of the standard library will
tend to emphasize one or the other.

It is striking how different these priorities are. We believe these technical factors have
contributed significantly to the persistence of specialized environments in this area.


%problem of finding connections between array programming and OOP.
%array programming is a powerful paradigm for describing computational
%kernels operating over potentially large amounts of data.

%an ``object system'' in this context is often considered a separate
%part of the language, to be used only when arrays no longer
%suffice.

%technical computing systems have an unusually large amount of
%``failure of abstraction'' --- manual duplication of facts
%all over the system. imagine changing from column-major to
%row-major.

\section{Proposed solution}

It is clear that any future scientific computing language will need to be able to
match the performance of C, C++, and Fortran. To do that, it is almost certain
that speculative optimizations such as tracing \cite{tracingjit} will not be sufficient ---
the language will need to be able to \emph{prove} facts about types, or at least
let the user request specific types. It is also clear that such a language must
strive for maximum convenience, or else the split between performance languages
and productivity languages will persist.

It is fair to say that two approaches to this problem are being tried: one is
to design better statically-typed languages, and the other is to apply
program analysis techniques to dynamically-typed languages.
Static type systems are getting close to achieving the desired level
of flexibility (as in Fortress \cite{fortresspec} or Polyduce \cite{polyduce1},
for instance), but it is still too early to call a winner between these two
approaches (if, indeed, there even needs to be a winner).

Our contribution derives from experience with the second approach.
Efforts to analyze and optimize dynamically-typed programs generally make two
assumptions: (1) we should work on analyzing \emph{existing} popular
languages, and (2) users of these languages don't want to use types.
The first assumption makes practical sense.
Convenience is hard to quantify, so using existing languages that have already
been deemed convenient by popular opinion puts us on solid footing.
%This thesis describes a new language, so we simply take the negation of the
%first assumption as a premise.
Our work addresses the second assumption more directly.
We point out that types
\footnote{For an excellent discussion of the many meanings of the word ``type''
see \cite{Kell2014}.}
do not have to be used for static checking, and that using them for
\emph{code selection} and \emph{code specialization} is particularly useful in
technical computing.
This perspective has not been explored thoroughly in the past.

When static analyses (often incorporating run-time information) are applied
to dynamically-typed programs, it is typically possible to recover a
significant amount of type information (TODO cite). What, then, can one
do with this information? If the goal is performance, various partial
evaluations can be done: generating code without type checks, removing
branches, type-specializing the storage of variables, and compile-time
method lookup are all valuable and yield large real-world gains.

However, we claim that the amount of information that can be statically inferred
exceeds most dynamic languages' capacity to exploit it. For example,
if method calls are dispatched on the first argument, but the types of all
arguments can be inferred, some power has been ``left on the table'' ---
we could have had multi-methods for little extra cost. In fact, method-at-a-time
JIT compilers (TODO cite) can specialize method bodies on all arguments,
and might use multiple dispatch \emph{internally} to select implementations
at run time (TODO cite a system that did this). This argument does not
apply equally to statically-typed languages, since they cannot simply
``switch'' their functions to generic functions without significant
consequences for type checking.

The ``wasted power'' problem applies to data structures as well.
For example, static or run time analysis might reveal that a certain array
can be represented as a native \texttt{Int32} array \cite{Bolz2013}.
If this information is not reflected in the source language, then
certain uses like passing data to native code become unnecessarily more
complicated.

Some levels of performance are difficult to reach with implicitly
specialized code and data. Given the knowledge that
an array contains only \texttt{Int32} data, we might want to go
beyond essential optimizations like storing intermediate values in
registers, and actually use different algorithms. For example,
in Miller-Rabin primality testing, checking three ``witness'' values
suffices for all 32-bit arguments, but up to seven values might be
needed for 64-bit arguments (TODO cite).
In cryptographic applications, exploiting this difference in an inner loop
could bring significant benefits.

In demanding applications, selecting the right algorithm might not
be enough, and we might need to automatically \emph{generate} code
to handle different situations. While these cases are relatively rare
in most kinds of programming, they are remarkably common in technical
computing. Code generation, also known as \emph{staged programming},
raises several complexities:

\vspace{-2ex}
\begin{singlespace}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the input to the code generator?
\item When and how is code generation invoked?
\item How is the generated code incorporated into an application?
\end{itemize}
\end{singlespace}




what to dispatch on? dispatch power has been extended in many ways, but
there is no real limit to what somebody might want to dispatch on.
so what to do?
some sets of values are more robust under computation than others
(closure properties).
identify those sets using dataflow concerns.

say we have a method defined for integers, and also for the special cases
``2'' and ``odd integers''. a realistic implementation
will group all of these under ``integer'', and ideally generate a couple
branches to handle the other cases. we argue the concept of ``integer''
here is a more robust set, and so a more fundamental language concept.


somewhat counter-intuitively, dynamic dispatch can be good for performance
since it permits invoking the most specialized possible method.
static overloading can lead to calling a sub-optimal case when multiple
overloads exist for the sake of performance.


%(one way to describe it: you can start with the notation you want, or with the
%notation that people are using already, and come up with better ways to
%*explain* it.
%in other words, design a robust framework that assigns a satisfactory meaning
%to each thing we'd like to write.
%the amazing thing about programming languages it that a better
%explanation can directly lead to better performance!)


% - mention dual traps of wasted power and divergence

%- vs predicate dispatch: we extend dispatch power in a different direction,
%guided by semantic subtyping. goal is maximum power that still yields high
%likelihood of resolving many calls to a single implementation.

past (static) type systems for dispatch were designed to ensure the absence of
no-method errors and ambiguities (completeness and uniqueness). our goal
is instead to statically resolve methods. this is inherently heuristic and
best-effort. since static types shouldn't affect program behavior, we
conclude that the dispatch must be dynamic, which is happily the same
conclusion you would reach if you simply wanted dynamic typing.

%it is quite possible that some static type system will work well for this
%however we defer this question.

interesting variants:
- require static single method matches
- reject programs with no-method errors
- reject programs that yield Unions

By \emph{selection} we mean any mechanism used to pick one of several
pieces of code to run. This includes object-oriented mechanisms, as well
as function overloading, and even branches.

By \emph{specialization} we mean transformation of a given piece of code,
particularly as done by a compiler to generate efficient code for some
special case of a flexible piece of high-level code.

Specialization entails program analysis. By necessity, a language's
code selection mechanisms must inform this process, to ensure the
correctness of the analysis. A central argument of this thesis is that
specialization should feed back into selection, allowing the
\emph{approximate values} processed by a compiler to be used in the
source language for dispatch. We argue that this is the key feature
missing from the present generation of dynamically-typed languages.
%This conclusion would not be surprising to advocates of static
%type systems, but the approach we propose is actually a run-time
%mechanism that does not restrict the class of valid programs.

Solution: integrate code specialization and code selection

Why integrate code specialization and code selection?

\begin{itemize}
\item specialization requires selection anyway
\item simpler system
\item can sometimes collapse 2 layers of dispatch into 1
\item can replace library code with a code generator without either changing
  client code *or* any extra overhead
\end{itemize}

Extensive code specialization is a key feature of
technical computing. ``what to specialize on'' has been an open problem.
our types are a possible solution to this for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item you can tune the amount of information they contain
\item everybody agrees to use them, which helps ensure that specializing on
  the types will actually do something useful.
\end{enumerate}


The key ingredients:

\begin{singlespace}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Self-describing data model aware of memory layout
\item Type tags with nested structure
\item A fully-connected type tree
\item Dynamic multiple dispatch over all types % including parameters and varargs
\item Dataflow type inference
\item Automatic code specialization
\end{enumerate}
\end{singlespace}

This list of features may appear somewhat ad-hoc. However, they turn out to be
remarkably strongly coupled, and deeply constrained by our ultimate goal.
Each of these features has appeared in some form before, but never in a way
that fully solves the problems described here.

Challenges of this approach (why has this not been done before?)


\section{Contributions}

1 - an analysis of the nature of technical computing that suggests what
sort of language would form a good base for it. it should emphasize
complex operators and code generation/specialization.

2 - the idea of integrating specialization and selection, using multiple dispatch
and semantic subtyping.

3 - an explication through elimination of technical computing language features

``One of the most fruitful techniques of language analysis is explication through
elimination. The basic idea is that one explains a linguistic feature by showing
how one could do without it.'' \cite{morris}

A main contribution of this thesis is the application of this approach to features
of technical computing environments that have not been subject to such analysis
before.
