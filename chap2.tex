\chapter{Historical background}

Technical computing today is an unwieldy hybrid of computing modalities

Descendants of the EDSAC (1951) era of batch processing. ``Job queue''

Fortran (1957), the first compiled high level language with performance
comparable to assembler. First designed for scientific computing,
but use spread also to business applications. Distinction between
high- and low-level languages.

Recap: how relevant is our historical baggage?

Distinction between interactive and batch computing modes

Distinction between low-level assembler and high-level

What's different in today's world
