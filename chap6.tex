Multiple dispatch on special matrices

\section{Boundary-element method}

There are lots of general packages for FEM problems, but it is much more
difficult to create such a package for BEM problems. The method requires
integrating functions with singularities, many times in the inner loop
of code that builds the problem matrix. Integrating such functions
numerically on each iteration is much too slow. As a result, many
special-purpose implementations have been written by hand for different
problems.

Some recent work (TODO cite Homer) managed a more general solution,
using Mathematica to generate C++ code for different cases. This worked
well, but was difficult to implement and the resulting system is difficult
to use. We see the familiar pattern of using multiple languages and
code-generation techniques, with coordination of the overall process done
either manually or with ad-hoc scripts.
