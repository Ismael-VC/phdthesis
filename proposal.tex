\def\title{Abstraction in Technical Computing}
\def\expectedcompletetiondate{May 2, 2014}
\def\briefproblemstatement{

Array-based programming environments are popular for scientific and
technical computing.
These systems consist of built-in function libraries paired with high-level
languages for interaction.
Although the libraries perform well, it is widely believed that scripting in these
languages is necessarily slow, and that only heroic feats of engineering can at
best partially ameliorate this problem.

In this thesis I argue that what is really needed is a more coherent
structure for this functionality. For this role I propose an abstraction
based on an extended version of generic functions. The novelty of this
mechanism is that it is both flexible enough to describe the wide
variety of behaviors users need in practice, while also providing
enough information to a compiler to yield good performance.


% Technical computing is characterized by great diversity and
% a rapid pace of change.

% dynamic flexibility is a good way to think about technical computing
% as a whole

% we don't know what people will want in the future, but
% a good way to try to provide for it is to at least be able
% to describe and implement what we want now. most systems
% can't even do this.

%Due to the great diversity and pace of change in technical applications,
%users would like to be able to extend and modify such systems.
%However, most of the functionality of these systems is ``built in'',
%% (rigidly defined?)
%and difficult to extend in a way that retains good performance.


%- adding a coherent structure to all the functionality, not just
%  an interface on top
%- develop a new methodology for creating one of these environments,
%  which extends to using it.


% must say something about: the key challenge is to provide the full
% rich behaviors that users expect.


%adding a coherent structure
%expressing everything with a uniform multimethod paradigm
%imagining multimethods as a solution to this, it also has to be
%extended
%if we extended multimethods in certain ways, they could solve this

%in order to motivate it you have to talk about technical computing,
%since that use case demands it.

%we want to implement technical computing within a uniform abstract
%framework. we invented a mechanism for doing that. 

%rather than taking multimethods as a fancy feature, we use it as the
%structural foundation of the system.

%expressive method signatures are simultaneously useful for the behavior
%they specify, and for the information they provide the compiler.
